# Travel Map
## By Ash Laidlaw

## About

This is a project designed to learn more about React. The goal is a travel management web app, to allow users to log into their own accounts and manage their travels. It will eventually implement the Google Maps API and allow users to create "trips" which will contain information about individual trips, including photos, summaries, and a map log.

At the moment, a user is able to add a trip to the database, and delete individual trips. Dynamic routing has been implemented, and I hope to have the Google Maps API linked up soon.

It is currently under development, so its functionality is currently limited. Stay tuned!
